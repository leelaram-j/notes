Data driven testing:

Properties class in java

Properties prop = new Properties();

always remember to give.properties to the input file name. as the Properties class recognizes only .properties extension.
key=value-> format in the .properties file

sample as below:
username=abcd
password=xyza
url=https://www.facebook.com

Test function as below:
@Test
    public void login() throws IOException
    {
        Properties prop = new Properties();
        FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("//Users//lee//eclipse-workspace//Framework//src//TestNGFiles2//inputData.properties");
        prop.load(fis);
        System.out.println("Username is "+prop.getProperty("username"));
        System.out.println("password is "+prop.getProperty("password"));
        System.out.println("URL is "+prop.getProperty("url"));
    }
	
For all practical purposes we will have to define the login functionality in a base class as it will be used in every test case. so create a baseclass for the same and just extend it in your testng class.

Also remember that when using Webdriver driver in if conditions declare them globally not inside the if condition.

check properties_selenium.java and testing_inheritance_selenium.java files for its implementation.
