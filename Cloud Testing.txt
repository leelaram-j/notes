Cloud based testing:
sauce labs can be used.

Executing selenium test cases in different combinations. diff os and diff browsers
running test cases with the help of 3rd party vendor.
DesireCapabilities class...main in using cloud based testing/hub-node scenario

Cloud testing and the selenium grid concept testing are the same, only difference is that url change.

Sauce Labs - cloud-based service to run Selenium tests faster and more easily.
BrowserStack - Selenium cloud testing in 300+ Real Desktop and Mobile Browsers.
TestingBot - easy cross browser testing with Selenium in the cloud.
Spoonium - unlimited Selenium testing on all major browsers.
CrossBrowserTesting - test Selenium on 1000+ browsers and devices in the cloud.
Ranorex - test automation framework with Selenium WebDriver plug-in to easily create and manage tests and run them on Selenium-supported platforms and browsers.
Selocity - Free Chrome browser extension to auto-generate robust CSS, XPath, link text, and RanoreXPath selectors.

some of the above helps us in running the selenium tests online. saucelabs testing bot,crossbrowsertesting etc.

A good practise while running the selenium automated test cases in cloud would be to define login functionality separately in a class or a function. and call the same in our program. pFB sample code.

public static void setup() throws Exception
    {
        DesiredCapabilities dc = DesiredCapabilities.firefox();
        dc.setCapability("version","5");
        dc.setCapability("platform","Linux");
        WebDriver driver = new RemoteWebDriver(new URL("http://uniformtangofoxtrot:96abb7b5-f73d-4bc8-b396-47586662fe45@ondemand.saucelabs.com:80/wd/hub")
                ,dc);
        driver.get("https://www.google.com");
        System.out.println(driver.getTitle());
        //driver.quit();
    }
