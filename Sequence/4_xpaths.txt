xpath interview questions;

Relative and absolute xpath :

xpath is address through which we traverse to find an element

relative xpath does not depend on parent node.

absolute xpath-we will traverse to the element with the help of parent nodes
parent-child relationship

we will have to write entire the xpath url...top to desired element traversing through nodes is absolute xpath.


Always relative xpath is preferred than absolute xpath..since any time dev may change the code of webpage then the entire xpath breaks.

Next question:

How to traverse to sibling node using xpath

in which scenario do we use id changind scenario

sample sibling eg.
//li[@id='tablist1-tab1']/following-sibling::li[1]

traversing between sibings in xpath
driver.findElement(By.xpath("//li[@id='tablist1-tab2']/preceding-sibling::li[1]")).click();

Identifying parent xpath using child
syntax:
child xpath/parent::tag name

Identifying the element using text()--> this can be used to select element with the text mentioned in it.
syntax: //*[text()='sample_text']

for eg. //*[text()='Go']
This will select the element with text Go in it...but make sure there is no other word like this. This is case sensitive and space sensitive.

what is the major difference between css and xpath?
in xpath u can traverse backwards, whereas in css u cannot traverse backwards


xpath functions

you can write xpaths like this
//input[starts-with(@id,'u_')]
this will select the element starting with u_. this is very helpful if we want to find a element with dynamic name/id

in similar way we can write
//input[ends-with(@id,'_u')]
this can be used if the starting name of an element is dynamic

in similar way if an element id has both starting and ending dynamic values then we can use
//input[contains(@id,'_u')]
This will search for element that has _u and select it.

For multiple attributes selection you can use and operator.
eg. //input[@attribute1='value1' and @attribute2='value2']
