Actions class in selenium web driver:
to handle mouse over and keyboard interactions
user gestures

mouse over: to move mouse over specific element;context click in mouse(right click),(double click)

-Start-
first we should invocate Actions class as they handle these sort of mouse/keyboard interactions.
syntax:
Actions a = new Actions(driver); //passdriver variable so that a can have driver capabilities.
next

a.moveToElement(id of element).build().perform();

build()-> it is used to build the action that is defined, but it will not execute the step.
perform()-> this will perform the action that is built.

build() and perform()->will always be used as composite statement.

for eg if we need to send a data in capital, we can use

a.moveToElement(id of element).click()
.keysDown(Keys.SHIFT)
.sendKeys("hello")
.doubleClick() // to double click the enetered text
.build()
.perform();

above command is used to select the text that is eneterd in a particualr textbox.

contextClick()-> this is used to right click an element

there are other options as well... please explore them.
