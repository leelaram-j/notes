Apache log4j:
It is an reliable fast and flexible logging framework(API) written in java, distributed by apache.

why?
send the entire logs
log only when there is an error for package A
log entire messages for package B
i want logs with timestamp
I want the log file of last week.
how will i know abt errors just by looking at logs



where to log? Appenders tag_ console
what to log  Loggers tag section section
how to log? Appenders tag_ console

remember when downloading the log4j jars...u need to add only 2 jars in ur project.

lo4j-api-current_version.jar
log4j-core-current_version.jar

when using log4j be sure to import 

import org.apache.logging.log4j.*;

cos LogManager is available in 2 packages one in java.util and another one is in org.apache.logging.log4j. So select the second one.

Appenders and Loggers

	-define the log level threshold above which to log for each resource
	-Attributes of each appender depend on the type of appender

Loggers

	-Define custom loggers for selected packages and classes
	-set the log level for each section
	-Set the appenders to be used for each section

Root Loggers

	-only one root logger
	-All loggers inherit attributes from roor and override root attributes
