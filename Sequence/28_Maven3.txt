Maven Interview Questions:

Maven is a build management tool

-Convention over configuration
-Dependency Management

Convention over configuration:

-main	
	-java (framework related classes)
	-resources(properties files or any configuration setting like environment ones)

-test
	-java(test classes)
	-resources (any configuration files needed for tests)

Ant vs Maven:

in ant we need to specify where the resources are, main funtions are, tests are...and what type of packaging.
but in maven since it is a structured folder model..everything is properly documented
