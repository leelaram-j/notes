driver.switchTo.alert method is used to send control from html to javascript...
for clicking ok
driver.switchTo().Alert().accept(); for all positive scenarios
driver.switchTo().Alert().dismiss(); for all cancelling and negtive scenarios
driver.switchTo().Alert().getText(); this is used to get all text from that alert that is generated.
//driver.switchTo().alert().sendKeys("fesfe"); this is used to send keyboard entered values to the alert.
