Selenium Grid Concept:

USage of hub and nodes to run scripts remotely in selenium.
 It is most helpful in case of cross browser testing
 
 First you need to download standalone server from seleniumhq
 
 and then register the standalone in hub machine using this command
 
 navigate to that folder
 
 java -jar seleniuum_jar_file_name.jar -role hub
 
 standalone server always runs on port 4444
 try
 http://localhost:4444/grid/console
 
 this will tell us whether selenium server is up and running or not..
 
 then download the standalone server in the node as wel.. then run 
 java -jar stand_alone_server_jar.jar -role webdriver -hub http://192.168.0.102:4444/grid/register -port 5566
 
 DesiredCapabilities capabilities = DesiredCapabilities.firefox();
       capabilities.setCapability(FirefoxDriver.BINARY,new File("C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Mozilla Firefox\\firefox.exe").getAbsolutePath());
    
      driver = new RemoteWebDriver(new URL("http://192.168.0.106:5566/wd/hub"), capabilities);
     
     
      
        driver.get("http://google.com");
        System.out.println(driver.getTitle());
 
 
 192.168.0.1.6:5566/wd/hub -> This is the URL of the node. Remember you always run the code in the hub and it runs in the node
