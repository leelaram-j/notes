navigate to the jenkins directory and run the above command. It will start the jenkins server on the specified port.
TO login to the server use 
localhost:8080 in browser.
It will start the jenkins server.

check whether jenkins is configured propely, first time it will take time to configure, set a password to access it.

use new item to add the project. select either maven or ant as build management tool. give the location of build.xml and just run the project.

view the changes in the console o/p.

we can also schedule the test to be run at a certain time. Should give pattern as below.

Scheduling:

MINUTES Minutes in one hour (0-59)

HOURS Hours in one day (0-23)

DAYMONTH Day in a month (1-31)

MONTH Month in a year (1-12)

DAYWEEK Day of the week (0-7) where 0 and 7 are sunday

If you want to shedule your build every 5 minutes, this will do the job : */5 * * * *

If you want to shedule your build every day at 8h00, this will do the job : 0 8 * * *

remember important thing while trying to configure jenkins is the jdk home, maven home and git..
java -jar jenkins.war --enable-future-java
