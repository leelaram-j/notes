In ths method, first web application is seprated to pages.
then for each page a class is created. and inside each page all the elements inside it are declared and written in functions as seen in PageObject_tutorial.
then in our tests, a object of that class is created and and using that object we can access the elements inside that class.
by this method, suppose we have 100 test cases and we need that needs to be performed in a same page. we don have to write the page elemenets 100 times we can just access it from that page class.

we can even use the Page Object factory method using @FindBy annotation, which makes finding and returning elements more simpler.



Page Object Factory method.

@FindBy(xpath=".//input[@id='login1']");
    WebElement userName;
