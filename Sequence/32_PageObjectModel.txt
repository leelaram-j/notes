Reduce or Eliminate duplicacy
Reusability of code
Reliability

Sample websie:

Homepage-Java class(Basepage)-Objects of home page
Login page-java classs(LoginPage)

In ths method, first web application is seprated to pages.
then for each page a class is created. and inside each page all the elements inside it are declared and written in functions as seen in PageObject_tutorial.
then in our tests, a object of that class is created and and using that object we can access the elements inside that class.
by this method, suppose we have 100 test cases and we need that needs to be performed in a same page. we don have to write the page elemenets 100 times we can just access it from that page class.

we can even use the Page Object factory method using @FindBy annotation, which makes finding and returning elements more simpler.



Page Object Factory method.

@FindBy(xpath=".//input[@id='login1']");
    WebElement userName;




Page Object Model:

-page object model is design pattern
-page object model defines:
	a) separate page class for each web page and
	b) each page class will have methods to find and perform operations on it web elements.

these go under /main/java/pages folder in maven folder type....
