Radio buttons.
it is same as checkbox, u can use the option to check whether it s enable or not using 
isEnable()
isSelected()

dont forgoet to use syso to get the o/p of the above functions as they return true or false

U can even use them in if conditions to check or validate them.

The most important function is size()
this function is used to get the number of radio buttons with same class names/values.

use syso to get the count of radio buttons in the page.

use findElements to get thelist of elements to an array. eg if u have 3 radio buttons and u need to click the third one and u dont have the name or id or value attribute, in that case you can use findElements()

sample
driver.findElements(By.cssSelector("[name='group1']")).size to get the count of elements under that group name

driver.findElements(By.cssSelector("[name='group1']")).get(i)

where i is the iterate in for loop that can be used to select the element/click it.

driver.findElements(By.cssSelector("[name='group1']")).get(i).getAttribute("value")

in place of value put the attribute for which u need the data and pass the value to a string, then u can either print it or use it in if condition or any other to do logixal tests accordingly.

eg.
if(s.equals("Cheese"))
{
driver.findElements(By.cssSelector("[name='group1']")).get(i).click();
}
