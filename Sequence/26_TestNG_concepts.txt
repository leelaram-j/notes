Parameterisation in TestNG:

General rules of framework is that certain repeated data should not be hardcoded. They should be in a centralized place and should be used as and when needed. urls,usernames,passwords etc


tests can be parameterized. It can done in 2 methods,
one via testNG xml file.
second via @DataProvider

First:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<suite name = "Automation Suite">
    <test name = "Smoke Test">
        <parameter name ="adminUserId" value="abcd" />
        <classes>
            <class name="TestNGFiles.parameters_from_xml" />
        </classes>
    </test>
</suite>

pass the parameter in the xml file. next in the test @Test command use this

@Test
    @Parameters({"adminUserId"})
    public void test1(String adminUserId)
    {
        System.out.print("The admin User Id is "+adminUserId+"\n");
    }
	
This would be helpful. either the value can be passed globally or for a particular class. This has to be mentioned in the XML file.

Test level parameterization in xml file
Suite level parameteriztion in xml file

Adding multiple parameterization using the below code
@Test
    @Parameters({"adminUserId,adminUserName"})
    public void test1(String adminUserId)
    {
        System.out.print("The admin User Id is "+adminUserId+"\n");
		System.out.print("The admin User Name is "+adminUserName+"\n");
    }


Second:
create a @DataProvider function as below
@DataProvider(name="dataProvider")
    public Object[][] getData()
    {
        // Object [i][j] means i->number of time the test should run,j means no. of parameters for a single run
        Object[][] data = new Object[2][2];
        data [0][0]="user1";
        data [0][1]="password1";
        data [1][0]="user2";
        data [1][1]="password2";
        return data;
    }

and before the test call it as seen below.
	
	@Test(dataProvider = "dataProvider")
	public void test112(String username,String password)
	{
		System.out.println("User name is "+username+" and password is "+password);
	}

Always remember in both methods the number of parameters passed in the test should be equal with the number of parameters passed in xml file or in the @DataProvider function.

Good practise is to wrtite the data provder function in a separate class. so in order to tell the testng to find the location of the
data provider, we need to mention the class name in the @Test section as seen below.

@Test(dataProvider="sampleProvider",dataProviderClass=TestData.class)

here the class name is TestData

TestNG Listeners:

Adding Listeners to execution, this helps us in monitoring certain actions.
eg. if test case fails, it needs to take a screenshots
eg. if REST API fails, we need to get logs..

Listeners listen to test case execution, if the execution fails it triggers a set of code block, if it passes it will trigger another code block.


Parallel Testing Concept:
run tests in a parallel way. This is not a optimized way of running the code. but in certain cases where we need to run tests parallely we can use this.
This can be controlled in testng xml file using the below attribute in suite level.

<suite name="smoketesting" parallel="tests" thread-count="2">

even the same can be done for classes as well
<test name="smokeTest" parallel="classes" thread-count="2">
this will run classes inside the tests parallely.

parallel="tests" --> each test method will run in a separate thread
parallel="methods" --> each test tag will be run in a separate thread
parallel="classes" --> each class will be run in a separate thread
parallel="instances" --> each instance of class will be run in a separate thread

Need for parallel execution:

1) faster execution time
test suites take considerable amount of time if tests are run in parallel.
2) test if application unders test are thread safe.


remember when running tests in parallel try to use local variables instead of instance variables as they are not thread safe.

In case of data provider setting parallel setting in suite file will not work, we need to change it at dataprovider level  

@DataProvider(parallel=true )
