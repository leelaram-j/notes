Visiblity test for elements:
This is done in order to find whether certain elements disappear after selecting some options.

eg in case of spicejet.com

on selecting multi city radio button, the return journey date element is disappeared. this can be a test case were to check whether certain elements are present or not.

check visiblity_test java file for further informations.

Point to note....
isDisplayed() method can be used only if the said element Is available in the webpage code, but is hidden .

Suppose there is a test case to check whether a particular element Is visible and the same element is not available in the code, then we can use the element id(previous id) 
and pass it in findElements(By.xpath(xpath value)).size();

this will return the number of elements present in the webapage with the said element id, and pass it to a integer.

check them with if statement
if(count==0)
{
syso("element not available");
}


isEnabled()- returns whether the passed element is enabled or not..this can be useful in a test case where we need to check if certain elements are present or not.


getText() method returns the text value of a passed element. It can be used to validate the location of texts..as that might be a test case

Boolean isSelected(): This method determines if an element is selected or not. It returns true if the element is selected and false if it is not.  It is widely used on check boxes, radio buttons and options in a select.

Boolean isDisplayed(): This method determines  if an element is displayed or not. It returns true if the element is displayed and false if it is not. Advantage of this method is that it avoids parsing an elements style attribute.

Boolean isEnabled(): This method determines if an element is enabled or not. It returns true if element is enabled (All elements apart from disabled input elements) and false if otherwise.
