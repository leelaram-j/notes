Interview questions:
frames handling,Actions class usage(mouse over and keyboard interaction,drag and drop concept),handling multiple windows,

mouse over action using 
act.moveToElement(elemt id)
.build()
.perform()


you can double click using doubleClick()
u can hold a button press using keysDown()
note that keysDown/keysUp take only 3 arguments
Keys.CONTROL
Keys.ALT
Keys.SHIFT
if you use any other then it will throw exception.

always remember to use build() and perform() to do the desired action, w/o this u cannot perform the action.

use contextClick() to right click on an element.

most important question: by which you can send the control between parent and child pages.

Set<String> ids = driver.getWindowHandles();
        Iterator<String> its = ids.iterator();
        String parentId = its.next();
        String childId = its.next();
        driver.switchTo().window(childId);
		
once switched to child window, u need to again switch to parent window in order to access elements in parent window

handling frames.

use driver.switchTo().frame() to go to frame and when u need to come out of it, please use driver.switchTo().defaultContent()


most important questions in interview:
1) send data in capital letters
2) mouse over functions
3) traversing between windows using getWindowHandle() and using set and iterator to cycle through it.
4) handling frames
