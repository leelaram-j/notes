MAven:

-main	
	-java (framework related classes)
	-resources(properties files or any configuration setting like environment ones)

-test
	-java(test classes)
	-resources (any configuration files needed for tests)



Page Object Model:

-page object model is design pattern
-page object model defines:
	a) separate page class for each web page and
	b) each page class will have methods to find and perform operations on it web elements.

these go under /main/java/pages folder in maven folder type....


Base Class and Utility Classes

-Base class defines variables and methods that are common between derived classes.
-Baseclass constructor should be invoked using 'super' keyword. It shuld be the first statement in the derived class constructor.
 -- interview question -> super(); this should be the first statement in the derived class constructor. if not compile will throw an
 	error
-Base class variable values can change between different instances of derived classes.

-utility classes consist of static variables and methods.

When to use Base class and Utility class -- interview question:

utility classes are static--methods...only one copy of variables/methods/classes are available. so for those we need only one
instances are put in utility classes.


Constants class:
in real time, when designing framework, the key in the .properties files are declared as public static final String in constant class.
that way they are easy to access.

need this place because, if there is any change in the key name, we need to change in multiple places. hence using this will
allow us to make change in only 2 places...one in the .properties file another one in the constants file.
this way it is easier for maintenance


Configuration files (aka) Environment or Property files

- Config files contain information that cannot be hardcoded and can be subject to cahnge
 information like usernames, password, file/directory paths etc go into config files.
- Some configuration files are shared betweenn diff environments (qa,regression)
- Some configuration files are separate across diff environments (qa,regression)
- Cofiguration files can be read using java properties object.


keywords:
- where super,abstract,static,final keywords are used.

abstract
should not be able to create an isntance for this class. this class can be extended but cannot be instantiated.
