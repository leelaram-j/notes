Websites has java alerts/popups that needs to be clicked in order go to next website.

if u right click on them and select inspect element, u cannot see the code as they are handled by javascripts.

in such cases it can be handled by using

driver.switchTo().alert().accept();

switchTo() will change the control of the function from html to js...switchTo() has other options as well check them out.


dismiss()
getText()
sendKeys() etc

Alert alert = driver.switchTo().alert();
System.out.println(alert.getText());
alert.accept();

 driver.switchTo().alert().accept(); for positive scenarios
        //driver.switchTo().alert().sendKeys("jdfsdfjdsfjsdjhfdsjfhdsj");
        //driver.switchTo().alert().dismiss(); This is done to dismiss changes or ignore or negative scenario buttons
