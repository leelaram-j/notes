For static checkboxes u can use select class to find elements,

syntax
Select S = new Select(xpath);

please note that only this will work when there is a select class with option...

multiple options available to select a item from drop down.

You can use selectByValue()
selectByIndex()
selectByVisibleText()
And many more options are available...need to check that as well..


Select s = new Select(driver.findElement(By.id("ctl00_mainContent_DropDownListCurrency")));
